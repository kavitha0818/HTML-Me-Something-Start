               This is our first international trip outside of US/India and during COVID. We haven't 
               ventured out a lot. We stayed in the resort. But, it was very interesting to see different people.
               My kids don't want to go to room. They love to play in the ocean. I just sat on the chair and watched them having fun. Even though I don't the laungage, people were very kind and 
               for showing kindness you don't need to speak the language.

                It gives peace of mind to forget everything and keep looking at the sea. I tasted different kind of cusine because it's 
                an all inclusive resort. Then we took a day trip to visit Chichen Itza. It's very hot and I couldn't stand that heat even 
                though I'm from a tropical country. Then we visited a Mayan heritage center to have lunch buffet and 
                we had a chance to understand their culture and watch their traditional dance. Finally, we went to 
                cenote and took a dip. Even though I was on Life jacket. I felt like I'm going to drown and I've to get help from one of our tour bus mate to get me to the shore.
                I can't forget it. Overall, it was a great experience.

               This trip took long time on the bus before reaching the resort. We were able to see downtown and people's habitats. It was
               beautiful to watch the sunset and the water is very clear and we were able to see starfish, crabs, Lobster, Baracuda, Sting ray, 
               We did paddle boat and able to see marine life. My kids are very exicted because there is literally no waves and clear water.
               It was a wonderful experience.
